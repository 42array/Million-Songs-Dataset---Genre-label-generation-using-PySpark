Genre Label Generation and Classification on Million Song Dataset



The project used PySpark to work with a 1.8GB subset of the Million Song Dataset (containing 10k songs) and trained four classifiers to predict genre label.

The code folder contains code for:
- importing the dataset from HDF5 files
- data preparation, including cleaning and feature engineering
- running LDA to generate genre labels
- data visualization
- training Decision Tree / Random Forest models
- training multi-class logistic regression model
- training multi-layer perceptron model
